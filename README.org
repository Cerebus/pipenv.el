A [[https://docs.pipenv.org][Pipenv]] porcelain inside Emacs.

** Overview

[[https://docs.pipenv.org][Pipenv]] is now the officially recommended Python packaging tool. It manages virtual environments, adds and removes packages, and enables deterministic build dependencies. Even better, =Pipfile= and =Pipfile.lock= replace =requirements.txt= bringing modern dependency management features to your Python projects.

=pipenv.el= makes Pipenv a first-class citizen in your Emacs-driven Python development workflow. You get interactive functions for all Pipenv commands, a minor mode with a key map for the most useful commands, and =pipenv-activate= / =pipenv-deactivate= functions for working with virtual environments.
